Yeah, this is what you just read: "a readme-template repository".
In this, i'll keep a padronization of all my project's readmes.

Feel free to copy them and modify for your own purposes

<br/>

**Here you will find the following templates:**

- [x] [In construction](./construction) - For those repos that doesn't have notthing yet <br/>

- [x] [All-in-one](./all-in-one) - The readme for monorepos <br/>

- [ ] [Mobile](./mobile) - A template for mobile apps <br/>

- [ ] [Server](./server) - For APIs and stuff<br/>

- [ ] [Web](./server) - To be used in frontend aplicattions <br/>

<br/>

Okay.. But *"why a multi-languaged readme"*?, you may ask.

Well.. if you're still here, let me tell ya a story:

<br/>

## :thinking: Should I make my READMEs in Portuguese or English?
<br/>

Even in the beggining of my journey doing READMEs, I was uncomfortable with this question. 
Well.. I live in Brazil and, even though some of us can comunicate in English very easilly, there is a huge percentage of us that can't.

Still, when making this question above, i've always got the **same answer**, almost instantly: 

> *"YOU SHOULD ALWAYS WRITE READMEs IN ENGLISH, SO EVERYONE WILL UNDERSTAND".*
>
> -- Comunity


As you can see, I wasn't convinced.

So, the only way was to do.. both.

<br/>

## :v: My answer is: Do both
<br/>

Considering github does not have any functionallity known by me (until this moment) as a "multi language support" or anything like that, I decided to use in this repo a known workaround that links another README file with the desired language.

If you notice, there is a "button" on the left-top of this file, like this:
  
[![en-badge](./.github/lg-button-pt.png)](./README.pt.md)

```
# you can do that this way:

[![en-badge](./.github/lg-button-pt.png)](./README.pt.md)

# or using an img tag in HTML

<a href="./README.pt.md">
  <img src="./.github/lg-button-pt.png" alt="pt-br" width="180px" ></img>
</a>
```

I've put this on every README file, which leads you to a "README.\< abreviation-of-choosen-language \>.md" (in this case, brasilian portuguese)

Simple as that.
