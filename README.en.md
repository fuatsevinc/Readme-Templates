Yes, that's what you just read: "a README template repository".
In it I will keep a Padronization of all readmes of my project.

Feel free to copy and modify them for your own purposes.

<br/>

**Here you will find the following templates:**

- [x] [In construction](./Construction/README.Construction.md) - For repositories that don't have anything yet 

- [x] [Django Projesi](./Django/README.Django.md) - For Django Projects 

- [x] [React Projesi](./React/README.React.md) - For React projects 

- [x] [Bootsrap Projesi](./Bootsrap/README.Bootsrap.md) - For Bootstrap Projects 

- [x] [Servisler](./Api/README.Api.md) - For APIs and stuff



Okay.. But *"why a multi-languaged readme"*?, you may ask.

Well.. if you're still here, let me tell ya a story:

<br/>

## :v: Of course.. You may ask why Readme in 3 languages ​​(Turkish, German, English) ?

Of course.. You may ask why Readme in 3 languages ​​(Turkish, German, English).

Well, let me tell you a story:


### I thought: Should I make my READMEs in Turkish or German or English?

Now I live in Germany and I work here. He uses German in daily life. 
I speak Turkish with close friends and circles around me, and I use English while developing software. 
I think it should be a Turkish resource for my friends who want to improve themselves in the field of software and do not speak English. 
I think that it will be beneficial for both me and my German friends in preparing a German Readme for my colleagues who do not speak English while looking for a job here in Germany.
I believe that Documentation is very important in any software project.
I always believe that Every Project should be readable and developed by Everyone.
For this reason, I read, benefit from and use many different sources as open source and I am very happy with it.
I think it is mandatory for all kinds of projects to be explained and the initial (setup) settings can be made in the Readme.
As someone who started software at the age of 36, I examine many projects on Github and try to improve myself.
During this research process, I realized that many Github projects either do not have README files or are too far from their target.
For this reason, I decided to create Ready-made README templates for those who are new to the software after my own projects.
After searching results on GitHub, I couldn't find a standard REPO that I could take as an example.
Maybe there are some very good ones! I haven't met yet.
